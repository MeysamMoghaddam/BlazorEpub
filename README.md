# What Is an EPUB File?
EPUB files can store words, images, stylesheets, fonts, metadata details, and tables of content.
They are considered layout agnostic, meaning that screen size doesn’t affect the formatting—EPUB files can display content on screens as small as 3.5″.
This and the fact it’s a freely available standard is why a majority of eReaders support EPUB files.
